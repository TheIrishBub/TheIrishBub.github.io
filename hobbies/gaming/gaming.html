        <h2>Mario Kart</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite game series, Mario Kart's Time Trials mode offers
          players the chance to show their skills by racing to get the best time
          they can in any of each game's courses.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.mariokart64.com/mk8/users/TheIrishBub">Here</a>
          is my Mario Kart 8 Player's Page. Mario Kart 8 is the latest main
          installment in the series, originally released for the Wii U in May of
          2014, but later got a re-release for the Nintendo Switch in April of
          2017.</p>
        <!-- I can update this page later to include links to my other player's pages. -->

      <h2>GoldenEye 007/Perfect Dark</h2>
      <p>These are classic first-person shooter games, released for Nintendo's
        N64 system. They have been out for about 20 years at this point, but I
        only recently started playing them, working on improving my times for
        each individual level.</p>
      <p><a href="https://rankings.the-elite.net/~TheIrishBub">Here</a> is a
        link to my the-elite.net times page. The times, if you click around on
        the left side of the page, are for GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. For
        some times, I have an accompanying video as proof of that time.</p>
      <p>For example, here is a video of me completing the game's first level,
        Dam Agent, in a mere 56 seconds:</p>

      <h2>The Legend of Zelda</h2>
      <p>Another one of my favorite series, the Zelda series has been a big part
        of my childhood, and continues to be to this day. My favorite game in
        the series would have to be Ocarina of Time, followed closely by Breath
        of the Wild, the newest entry into the series.</p>
      <p>Speaking of Breath of the Wild, my only claim to fame in this game is
        my world record in a specific mini game, namely Sand Seal Racing. If you
        would like to check it out, here is the video:</p>

    <div class="other">
      <p>There are many other games and franchises that I like to play, like
        Resident Evil: Revelations, the Pokemon games, and the Golden Sun
        series, but I didn't want to take up too much space on this page.</p>
