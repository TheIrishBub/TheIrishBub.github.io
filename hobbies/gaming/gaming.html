      <h2>Mario Kart</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite game series, Mario Kart's Time Trials mode offers players the chance to show their skills by racing to get the best time they can in any of each game's courses. <!-- (I can include my times page for the latest entry, "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe", as well as make another page with links to times pages for each game in the series.) --></p>

        <p><a href="https://rankings.the-elite.net/~TheIrishBub">Here</a> is a link to my the-elite.net times page. The times, if you click around on the left side of the page, are for GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark, both are classic games released for Nintendo's N64 console. For some times, I have an accompanying video as proof of that time.</p>
        <p>For example, here is a video of me completing the game's first level, Dam Agent, in a mere 56 seconds:</p>
