        <p>I don't have too much to show here, as I only worked on one project, but
          I want it talk about it here anyway. First, a bit of back story: one of my
          favorite games of all time is Golden Sun: The Lost Age. It was a game I
          played a lot of when I was a kid. Some late-game items are difficult to
          obtain, and are made easier with RNG manipulation methods (RNG stands for
          Random Number Generator). The RNG in this game follows a specific formula,
          and when one knows the formula and what advances it, one can predict the
          outcome of events in the game.</p>
        <p>I have written a program in C++ that will give me a list of random
          numbers, and I can then use those numbers to determine what events will
          happen and when they will happen.</p>
        <p>At a later point, I would like to add the program to this site, but as of
          right now, I don't yet have the knowledge to be able to do that.</p>
